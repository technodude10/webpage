        <strong>Significance of Tech Communities and Technical Events</strong>
      </h1><p>
        <em>Getting involved with communities has been the most important thing that helped me advance my skill set.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Why do we have so many tech events and groups? Have you ever thought about the influence of such communities in your career development? I’m going to give you my honest opinion on why you should get involved with communities and what you can achieve as a result of that.</p>
      <p>So let us begin with my story as an example. I have always been obsessed with technology and making things. From the day I got “connected to the internet” I used it mostly to learn more about technology. I used Facebook to its full potential to join many Facebook groups that focused on such topics. That was my first exposure to a tech community. It was mostly people asking doubts, others clearing those doubts, and so on. Going through these posts I learned a lot and virtually met some cool people.</p>
      <p>Then it led to the creation of a WhatsApp group and I was lucky enough to be part of that group. This group proved to be a game-changer in my life. Who would have thought a single WhatsApp group can alter your life like this! With the help of this group, we were able to connect with like-minded people across Kerala. I came to know about different sites, global communities, and forums dedicated to makers. Soon I started publishing my own projects to these online communities. My posts started getting recognition from fellow creators and some companies even offered to send some of their products and gifts.</p>
      <blockquote>So that brings us to, lesson number one → Use the internet to get connected. Leverage social media to develop your skills and connections.<p id="6a73bfa3-5566-4a80-bdb9-225c053afefa" class=""><em>Lesson number two → If you are good at something, try to put it out there somewhere on the internet. Someday it will become useful</em></p></blockquote><p id="b08df961-37ad-46d5-b62a-06b25169f0c6" class="">Enough about me, let’s get back to the matter at hand, how can you start getting involved? and why you should consider becoming part of a community?</p></div>
